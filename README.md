This article demonstrates how to fill an empty area with dotted lines in .NET MAUI Cartesian Charts.

In .NET MAUI Charts, filling an empty area with dotted lines involves customizing the appearance of the chart to create a visual representation of data gaps using dotted lines. This is particularly useful when there are missing data points or gaps in the dataset, and you want to emphasize these areas.

You can achieve this by modifying the series or axis appearance in the .NET MAUI Charts. By setting specific properties related to line styling, such as dash patterns, you can create a pattern of dotted lines to fill the empty spaces in the chart. This enhances the overall clarity of the chart, making it easier for users to identify trends or gaps in the data.
